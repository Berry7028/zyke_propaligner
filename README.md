# Information

This is an easy-to-use solution to your prop alignment hell. With our sleek UI you can utilize inputs, history & presets to speed up your alignment for your props.

The entire project is the first effort to make a great alignment menu, and more updates to streamline the process will come in the future once I am available to work on it.

# Features
- Sleek & modern UI for all inputs along with smart validation.
- Supports multiple props.
- Offset & rotation to player.
- Particle alignments offset from the prop.
- Possible to integrate into resources using exports, provide & return alignments with ease.
- Plays animation for realistic interactions, with different speeds.
- Server-wide presets to load pre-defined configurations.
- Export & import presets to share.
- Client-sided history to save your recent configurations.
